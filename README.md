# Phosphorus

Procrastination project. Some day, probably, I can make some applications with this handmade framework.

## Some targets to work towards

- [ ] Make a working 2D renderer that can render textured quads in OpenGL
- [ ] Make basic audio playback working
- [ ] Make it work under Linux
- [ ] Support Direct3D 11/Direct3D 12/Vulkan?

## Why this name though?

There was another abandoned game engine project by me, called Sulfur, since it is solely based on Vulkan. *(Vulkan is somewhat related to volcano, and then somewhat related to sulfur dioxide, then sulfur. I know, quite a stretch...)* Also my handle *Chlorie* originates from chlorine, so it is just natural for me to pick another element name for my new project.
